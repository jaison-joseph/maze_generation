-O3  >  -Ofast

2.58: original

2:05 threadpool

<= 2:00 single instance of the RNG

1:50 inlines the mutation and crossover methods

1:17 no floating point division: updated rng generator bounds and adjusted probability calculation

at this point, -Ofast ~= -O3

1:14 gettting rid of 2d arrays for indices in pathfinder
    - it's called ~36 million times

-O2 performs better on M2
but -O3 with mcpu does best overall {-O2 | -O3: -mcpu=apple-m2 | N/A }
-funroll-loops doesn't do anything

~1:12:500 using pointers

[1:04 - 1:16] after passing refs to input for threads instead of any copying hahahah

try:
    -march=native
    -flto

# for debugging:
    -fno-omit-frame-pointer /
    -g // debug symbols

in the versions of runner with mutex/cv based thread communications, inlining the barrier method versus not doesn't seem to impact performance
